/**
 * These are properties that are to be loaded from workspace_properties.xml. They
 * will provide custom labels and other UI details for this application and
 * it's custom workspace. Note that in this application we're using two different
 * properties XML files. simple_app_properties.xml is for settings known to the
 * Simple App Framework and so helps to set it up. These properties would be for
 * anything relevant to this custom application. The reason for loading this stuff
 * from an XML file like this is to make these settings independent of the code
 * and therefore easily interchangeable, like if we wished to change the language
 * the application ran in.
